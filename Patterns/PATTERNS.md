### âœ… 5. If given a linked list, then:
#### âœ¨ How the problem might look like:
- "Find the middle node of a linked list."
- "Detect and remove a cycle."
- "Reverse a linked list."

#### ðŸ”§ Common Techniques:
- **Two Pointers (Fast/Slow)** â†’ "Detect cycles, find the middle."
- **HashMap (Set for visited nodes)** â†’ "Cycle detection without modifying list."
- **Stack** â†’ "Reverse traversal, palindrome check."

### âœ… 6. If recursion is banned, then:
#### âœ¨ How the problem might look like:
- "Implement a function without recursion."
- "Convert a recursive DFS to an iterative one."
- "Process function calls manually."

#### ðŸ”§ Common Techniques:
- **Stack** â†’ "Simulate recursion manually."
- **Iterative Traversal** â†’ "Use while loops instead of recursion."
- **Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up)** â†’ "Break recursion dependency."

### âœ… 7. If must solve in-place, then:
#### âœ¨ How the problem might look like:
- "Modify the input array without using extra space."
- "Swap elements efficiently."
- "Find the next permutation without extra memory."

#### ðŸ”§ Common Techniques:
- **Swap Values** â†’ "Rearrange elements without extra memory."
- **Two Pointers** â†’ "Rearrange elements efficiently."
- **Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection** â†’ "Find cycles in O(1) space."

### âœ… 10. If asked for common strings, then:
#### âœ¨ How the problem might look like:
- "Find the longest common prefix."
- "Check if a word is present in a dataset efficiently."
- "Return the most frequent words."
