# LeetCode Solutions by Max Lasitsa

Welcome to my **LeetCode** repository! Here, you'll find my solutions to various LeetCode problems. I aim to constantly improve and upload more solutions over time, so stay tuned for more content.

## ðŸš§ More Problems Coming Soon ðŸš§

While Iâ€™ve already uploaded several solutions, there are many more on the way. Iâ€™m working through them gradually and refining my approach as I go.

## My Mission

Iâ€™m not a super expert (yet ðŸ˜‰), but Iâ€™ve found that while there are some excellent resources out there, many of them donâ€™t go into the kind of in-depth explanations that can really help someone grasp the "why" behind the code.

One such great resource is **NeetCode**, but I found that even then, I sometimes needed to go deeper to understand the full picture. For me, print statements and AI tools played a huge role in reaching that deeper understanding.

## Future Plans

In the near future, I plan to launch a **YouTube channel** where Iâ€™ll walk through every LeetCode problem in **detailed depth**. I believe this is what a lot of people are missing â€“ real, step-by-step breakdowns of the solutions and why certain choices are made in the code.

### Why This Matters

Iâ€™ve noticed that for myself, understanding the deeper mechanics of algorithms and data structures often required more than just watching quick solutions. By combining explanations, visual aids, and code walkthroughs, I aim to fill this gap and help others like me who need that extra clarity.
